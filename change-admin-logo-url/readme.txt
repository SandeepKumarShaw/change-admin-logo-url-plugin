== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make another admin logo plugin?  =

There are already quite a few plugins that offer similar functionality, but the fact that my plugin uses the WordPress Media Library makes it super easy to upload and edit your own logo.

I also am not aware of any other plugins that allow you to specify a clickthrough url for the logo.
